# Backend Structure Guide

- The backend code is located in the [server](mdc:server) directory.
- The main management script is [server/manage.py](mdc:server/manage.py).
- Backend applications are organized in [server/apps](mdc:server/apps), including:
  - [website](mdc:server/apps/website)
  - [users](mdc:server/apps/users)
  - [blogs](mdc:server/apps/blogs)
  - [uploads](mdc:server/apps/uploads)
  - [auth](mdc:server/apps/auth)
- Each app typically contains [views.py](mdc:server/apps/website/views.py), [models.py](mdc:server/apps/website/models.py), [admin.py](mdc:server/apps/website/admin.py), and [tests.py](mdc:server/apps/website/tests.py).
- Database file: [server/db.sqlite3](mdc:server/db.sqlite3)
- Configuration files and settings are in [server/config](mdc:server/config).

Refer to the [project structure guide](mdc:project-structure.mdc) for an overview of the entire project.
