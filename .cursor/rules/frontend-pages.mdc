# Frontend Pages Guide

The main page components for the frontend are located in [app/src/pages](mdc:app/src/pages):

- [Index.tsx](mdc:app/src/pages/Index.tsx): Likely the landing or home page of the application.
- [NotFound.tsx](mdc:app/src/pages/NotFound.tsx): Handles 404 or unmatched routes.
- [ProfilePage.tsx](mdc:app/src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx): Displays user profile information.

These components are typically routed from the main app component ([App.tsx](mdc:app/src/App.tsx)).

Refer to the [frontend structure guide](mdc:frontend.mdc) for more details on the frontend organization.
